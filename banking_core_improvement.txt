Improvement 1: Fix arithmetic operators

Replaced incorrect operators (=+ and =-) with the correct in-place
operators:

    self._balance += amount
    self._balance -= amount

This ensures the balance is updated instead of overwritten.

Improvement 2: Don’t access private attributes from subclasses

Replaced double-underscore private attributes (__balance) with protected
ones (_balance). This avoids name-mangling issues and allows child
classes to work safely.

Improvement 3: Add validation & return booleans

Deposit and withdrawal methods now: - Validate amounts (no zero or
negative values) - Return True/False to indicate success or failure This
makes transfer logic reliable and realistic.

Improvement 4: Separate responsibilities

-   BankAccount handles generic account behavior.
-   SavingsAccount adds interest-related functionality.
-   CurrentAccount adds overdraft-specific behavior.

This keeps the code clean and follows object‑oriented principles.

Improvement 5: Improve transfer logic

Transfer only succeeds if withdrawal succeeds. Prevents partial
transfers and keeps accounts consistent.

Improvement 6: Add meaningful comments

Added short, clear comments explaining WHY decisions were made. This
makes the code easier to understand for interviewers.

Improvement 7: More realistic banking behavior

-   Prevent negative deposits/withdrawals.
-   Respect overdraft limits.
-   Clean, formatted balance display.
-   Consistent naming and structure.
